                a criminal offence.

              <h2>Access to Personal Data </h2>
              <p>
                The Data Officer is responsible for maintaining and safeguarding
                Personal Data, and for ensuring that access to such Personal
                Data is restricted to persons who have a job-related "need to
                know" or who have documented access rights. Covered entities may
                have access to Personal Data on a business related need to know
                for purposes generally compatible with the collection of the
                Personal Data.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                Data Subjects may review the contents of any files as requested
                pursuant to the access principles detailed above and subject to
                other Aremko Pay policies. All Data Subjects must authenticate
                themselves based on online or offline standards (i.e., pass
                codes) set by Aremko Pay before gaining access. Data Subject may
                request a copy of documents, but under no circumstances will an
                individual be allowed to remove any documents from the file or
                be allowed to remove the original file from Aremko Pay. Certain
                confidential files, such as investigative files, will not be
                accessible to Data Subjects, in particular employees.{" "}
              </p>
              <h2>Verification of Employment </h2>

                employee's status which may be received from non-Aremko Pay
                entities, only members of the human resources department are
                authorized to release any information and this will be
                restricted to confirmation of current employment including the
                employee's name, the most recent job title and the dates of
